# PlantSense ðŸŒ¿ðŸŒ±

Welcome to the PlantSense GitHub repository!

PlantSense is a Flutter application designed to empower users with the ability to classify plant diseases. With a simple interface, users can easily upload images of plants, and the app will send a POST request to our API for disease classification. The API leverages a state-of-the-art plant disease image classification model to provide users with valuable insights.

## How It Works:
Image Upload - Users can upload images of plants directly through the app.

API Processing - The app sends the uploaded image to our API, where the plant disease image classification model works its magic.

Disease Classification - The API returns the top 3 probable diseases along with their confidence values. Users can now identify potential plant diseases with ease.

## Supported Diseases:
PlantSense currently supports the classification of the following diseases:

1. Tomato Septoria Leaf Spot
2. Tomato Bacterial Spot
3. Tomato Blight
4. Tomato Spider Mite
5. Tomato Leaf Mold
6. Tomato Yellow Leaf Curl Virus
7. Soy Frogeye Leaf Spot
8. Soy Downy Mildew
9. Maize Ravi Corn Rust
10. Maize Grey Leaf Spot
11. Maize Lethal Necrosis
12. Cabbage Black Rot
